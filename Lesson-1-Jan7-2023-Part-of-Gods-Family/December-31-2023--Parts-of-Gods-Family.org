#+title: December 31 2023 Parts Of Gods Family

“Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us?” (Mal. 2:10). We share the same origin and the same father. Does that make us part of God’s family?

If we are part of God’s family, what can we receive from our Father? What are our responsibilities?

The Bible encourages us to manage for the Lord until He comes back.

- Who is part of God’s family?
- Who is the owner of everything?
- What resources are at our disposal?
- What are our responsibilities?
- What should we do with what we have?

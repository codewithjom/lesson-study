Adam was “the son of God” (Luke 3:38). Does it mean that all his descendants are children of God too (Mal. 2:10)?

All humans are children of God because of Creation.

However, this doesn’t make us part of God’s family. In order to be part of His family we must be “born of God”. (1 John 5:1)

John explained that we are children of God because He loves us (1 John 3:1-2). When Jesus became human, He became part of our family so anyone who wants to be part of God’s family can be so (Heb. 2:11-18). This is why Jesus talked about “my Father” and “your Father.” (John 20:17)

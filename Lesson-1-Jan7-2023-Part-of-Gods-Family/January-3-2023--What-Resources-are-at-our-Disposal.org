God is the owner of all the resources in this planet. He’s willing to give them to His children.

However, the greatest gift He’s given us is His Son, Jesus (John 3:16).

1. Existence (Acts 17:25)
2. Salvation (1 Peter 1:5)
3. The Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13)
4. Spiritual Gifts (1 Corinthians 12:7-11)
5. Material Blessings (Matthew 6:31-33)

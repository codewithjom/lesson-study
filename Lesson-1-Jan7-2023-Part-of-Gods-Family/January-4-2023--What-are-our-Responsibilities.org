God has given us everything, and He has appointed us as stewards of it (Genesis 1:27-28).

He’s also expecting a response of love (Matthew 22:37). How can we show that we love Him?

John explained it: “In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome.” (1 John 5:3)

Loving God involves obeying His commandments. We cannot say that we love our Heavenly Father if we are not willing to obey Him.

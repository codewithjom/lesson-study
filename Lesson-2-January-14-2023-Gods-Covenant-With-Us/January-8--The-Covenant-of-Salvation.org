Salvation is not a unilateral covenant from God’s side. Therefore, not everyone will be saved no matter what they do or believe. It’s a bilateral covenant between God and humankind: Believe [our part] … and you will be saved [God’s part]” *Acts 16:31*.

It’s a simple covenant. There are no complex or hard clauses. It’s main goal is to give us eternal life *1 John 5:13*.

However, this is not a covenant that’s signed once and then forgotten: “but the one who stand firm to the end will be saved”. *Matthew 24:13*.

When Paul was about to die, he was sure that he had “kept the faith,” and that he would receive “the crown of righteousness” with “all who have loved His appearing” *2 Timothy 4:6-8*

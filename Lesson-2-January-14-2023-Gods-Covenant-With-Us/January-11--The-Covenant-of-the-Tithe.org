#+title: January 11 The Covenant Of The Tithe

#+begin_quote
  “Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house, and try Me now in this, says the Lord of hosts. If I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it.” - Malachi 3:10

Malachi wrote those words in a moment when the people of Israel had forgotten their part on God’s covenant. Therefore, he said: “Return to Me, and I will return to you” *Malachi 3:7*.

Then he proposed a covenant, a material covenant with spiritual consequences. This covenant is also valid for us today: Bring me the tithe and I will bless you *Malachi 3:10*

The people of Israel proved that this covenant is valid. In times of king Hezekiah, “they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything” *2 Chronicles 31:5*. Then they could say that “the Lord has blessed His people.” *2 Chronicles 31:10*

The covenant of the firstfuits works as follows:

- Our part: Giving God the first and the best
- God’s part: Blessing the rest

This covenant includes the fruit of our work, our affection, our time…

It may sound illogical, because if we give the first and the best, then we will have less and worse remaining… However, this is different with God. Why?

God invites us to “trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding” *Proverbs 3:5*

Besides the blessing that comes from God, the Bible is also full of advice to effectively manage our money, our affection, our time…

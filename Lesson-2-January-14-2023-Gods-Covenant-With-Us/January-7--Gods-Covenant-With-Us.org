#+title: January 7 Gods Covenant With Us

Although there are some exceptions, a covenant is usually a contract between two parties. Both parties commit to fulfill their part. Besides, the conditions of the covenant and the possible causes of cancellation must be clearly stated.

God has made some unilateral covenants with humankind (Genesis 9:11). However, most of His covenants are bilateral. That is, God will do something if the people involved fulfill their part.

- The covenant of salvation
- The covenant of blessing
